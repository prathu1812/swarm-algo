# Signature of Sine Cosine Algorithm 
Signature analysis of the algorithm is a tool to study the biases of any meta-heuristic algorithm. For performing signature analysis, 
an impossible plateau or a constant function is optimized using the underlying meta-heuristic algorithm. As the underlying algorithm is optimizing a constant function, the algorithm should randomly distribute the solutions in the search space. This code finds the intrinsic biases of the Sine Cosine Algorithm. 
I have added signature analysis for Sine Cosine Algorithm for tutorial purposes.![SignatureSCA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60783910/223077031-dfa4cf41-0efb-4261-882d-24779305683d.jpg)

Sine Cosine Algorithm is diagonally biased and distributes solutions in the first and third quadrants of the search space.
