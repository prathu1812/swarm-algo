# Signature of Sine Cosine Algorithm 
Swarm Intelligent Algorithm are gaining popularity in the field of Optimization. Hoever, these algorithms have theor intrinsic biases.
That means Algorithms can generate solution in a particular region of the search space without considering into the account of underlying objective function.
Signature analysis of the algorithm is a tool to study the baises of the algorithm. It is performed using the following ways 
A impossible palteau or in other words a constant function is optimized using the underlying meta-heusitic algorithm. As the underlying algorithm is optimizing a constant function, it means alorithm should randomly distribute the solutions in the search space.
I have added signature analysis for Sine Cosine Algorithm for tutorial purposes.![SignatureSCA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60783910/223077031-dfa4cf41-0efb-4261-882d-24779305683d.jpg)

We can see the Sine Cosine Algorithm is diagonally biased and distributing solutions in first and third quadrant of the search space.
